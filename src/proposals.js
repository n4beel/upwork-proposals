		"coverLetter": "Hi there,\n\nThe description does look intriguing and I most definitely can assist you with this task. Let me elaborate.\n\nI\u0027m a Ph.D. in Aircraft Design Manufacturing and Testing and I work with a Data Science team based in Ukraine. It consists of people with similar skills and expert fields, still among the strongest aspects is that we\u0027re combining hands-on programming experience with a knowledge in mathematics and computer science which allows us to successfully apply them in software development. We are engaged in solving problems in such fields as machine learning, applied mathematics, statistics, predictive analytics, data mining, and scraping computer vision.\n\nI have experience developing object detectors. You can see an example of one of the project on this demo server https://cars-detector.requestumdemo.com/use/6a3eb52be4e4c0e2f1d55b373bc2ee859f2c51f7\n\nThe project was related to the detection of cars on satellite maps and the calculation of the density of their distribution over the area.\n\nAnother successful case is the training of a custom object detection model that specializes in detecting soccer players. The trained model showed significantly better results compared to the pre-trained model for YOLOv3 object detector. You can see an example in this video https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bS3FdyLCM2jURLV9GXooxukhEjXIAjxA\n\nThus, I have the necessary skills and experience to successfully implement your project.\n\nI\u2019m really keen to learn more about the project and share my thoughts on ways to resolve the task so please answer me and let\u2019s start our communication.\n\nKind regards,\nVadym S.",

As per your job requirements, you need computer Vision expert to create a system in which you can take pictures of driver and the vehicle when they arrive and depart from our garage. \n\nFOR THIS PROJECT :  Firstly, I will be applying an object detection algorithm to detect cars and by taking the license plate location, I will extract numbers and store it on database. For driver detection I will be applying the face recognition technique and assign an id to them and track accordingly and capture the actions taken by the driver and check on which car he or she has sat.\n\nI have done a similar project as Driver Drowsiness Detection System: This project is accomplished for the U.A.E based client. we have to build a custom face detection and landmarks recognition model with the backed on Resnet 53 and Keras.Tensorflow as a framework. It is a computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness at a real-time video stream and then play the alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy. It is determined by how long a given person\u2019s eyes have been closed for, If eyes have been closed for a certain amount of time, we\u2019ll assume that he is starting to doze off and play the alarm to wake him up and grab driver\u2019s attention.\n\nWe can discuss the details over chat, feel free to message me and ask any question. Let me talk about my EXPERIENCE now.\n\nWell, regarding this project, I have extensive 2+ years of experience in DEEP LEARNING, MACHINE LEARNING \u0026 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE projects using Python. I have worked in an efficient and correct way. As you can see in my profile, I have been worked for different projects and got a response from employers by getting awesome feedback. I will surely complete work within the required time.I have worked across various domains such as building data pipelines, Banking, Insurance, Healthcare, Telecom, Business Development.\n\nI have been working for the following field related projects:\n\nClassification, Regression, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Prediction, Recognition, Time Series Forecasting, Recommender Systems, Sentiment Analysis, NLP(Natural Language Processing), Big Data Visualisation, Data Mining, Data Analysis, Data warehousing, Data Modelling\nSo on . . .\n\nSome of the projects on which I worked are: (some are attached with proposal)\n\n- Movie Recommendation website using Machine Learning + Web Development Knowledge\n- Image Segmentation\n-Emotion Recognition\n- Machine Learning Bot that plays Tic Tac Toe at 10x10 board size. The tree size of 10x10 board is more than the number of atoms in the universe.\n-Brain MRI Images classification\n-Driver Drowsiness Detection System\n- Age, Gender prediction by looking at the face of a person\n- Hair Segmentation\n- Fashion Style Classification\n-AI model for Building Inspector\n- Object Detection\n- Automatic License Plate Recognition\n- Security System for boats and ships\n- Facial Recognition\n- Potential Customer prediction\n- Predict if a comment is toxic or not\n- Predict how likely a windows machine is to be hit by malware.\n\nTools I use:- - Python - R - Matlab - Numpy/ pandas/matplotlib - scikit learn - tensorflow - keras - yolo api \u2013 pytorch, Augmented reality, virtual reality\n\nPlease contact me, I hope you share the details related with this job.\n\nI will look forward your positive reply\nThanks\nDeepanshu",

			"description": "Hi,  I\u2019m a web/mobile developer and developed my first program 22 years ago when I was 10 :). Also, I\u2019m a tech leader of outsourcing software company. With my team, I have developed more than 100 projects over the last 5 years. \n\nI\u2019m good at formalizing business requirements into working solutions with clean commented code covered with tests. I have strong fundamental skills in the computer science field, country-level programming contests won and tons of real-life development experience.\n\nI aim to create products for people, and I do care about real use cases and UI. For example, I have developed \u201cGerman Tinder,\u201d educational social network for the University of North Carolina, an E-commerce platform for Canadian medicine provider and many other projects that are used by thousands of people.\n\nMy expertise lies in both MEAN and LAMP stack development. I love API-first paradigm with React.js/Angular.js/Redux on the frontend, PHP/NodeJS for the backend for complex interface rich apps.  Also, I\u2019m ok creating classy PHP/SQL web apps that output HTML right from the backend.\n\nMy focus for business development is to find the best tool for the job, either an existing service or one I build myself. The tool can be a small plain PHP script or large modular MVC app based on Laravel/Symfony. Whatever gets the job done!\n\nToday I\u2019m willing to take a new feature-rich and exciting project. Besides me, I have more than 50 employees on my team, including PM\u2019s to handle the development process smoothly. Especially I would love to work with BigData or projects requiring hard skills in math or biology. For example, I\u2019ve developed a math engine for casino slot machines, a social network for animal breeders where genetics knowledge was in use or did a cryptocurrency stock exchange simulation app.\n\nSo, how about a chat or call about your next project? ;-)",

I don\u2019t need micromanagement, just give me detailed documentation and healthy communication. Be sure, you will see significant progress in reasonable deadlines.\n\nPlease see my general workflow:\n\n1.Goal Identification\nThe main point of this phase is to find out the purpose of the website creation/redesign. This stage requires active cooperation with you, to be able to answer the core questions and to move forward to the next steps.\n\n2. Research and scope definition\nOnce I know the website\u0027s main goals, I can define the scope of the project (what pages and features the site require to fulfill the goal). The major part of this stage is the research of the industry and similar/competitor products.\n\n3. Sitemap and wireframe creation: \nFinishing with the results, I start with the sitemap creation and wireframing. In this stage the deliverables are wireframes to confirm the layout and functionality of each page. Each screen should be discussed and confirmed with you.\u2028It\u2019s highly favorable to do this stage at least simultaneously with the content creation.\n\n 4.

Final Deliverables\nIn this stage I will organize the final deliverables based on your and developer needs.\n\n6.

Let\u0027s discuss it in detail.\n\nOur Senior UI/UX designer has about 10+ years of experience in creating designs for websites, landings, mobile apps, corporate identity kits, magazines, etc\n\nA little about how we work and we deliver to our clients:\n- Vector logo or outline of the current raster logo in vector;\n- Color scheme;\n- Development of detailed wireframes to demonstrate all screens of user behavior and interaction with the interface. We make Wireframes in two sizes for desktop and mobile. But if necessary, we can make a tablet variant too.\nAlso, when developing wireframes, we use the final content (text). We initially take into account the features of the front-end framework and grid that will be used on the project;\n- Style Guide;\n- Development of mockups (PSD, Sketch_app or Figma) in 4 sizes of desktop, lap-top, tablet and mobile. Mockups also show in detail the full user interaction with the UI. \n- Workflow scheme (if necessary);\n- Unloading mockups in Avocode or Zeplin.\n\nHere you can see some examples:\nBranding and Logo design: http://view.maquetter.com/atinao/0102\nStyle Guide: http://view.maquetter.com/atinao/0101\nWireframe: http://view.maquetter.com/atinao/0104\nLanding page design: http://view.maquetter.com/atinao/0103\n\nOur company website: http://abz.agency \n\nBest regards,\nIhor",

		"coverLetter": "Hi Hussain\n\nThanks for reaching out! \nThis is a very exciting project and we would be happy to employ our experience and expertise to create a user-friendly platform for you!\nWe are Habitat - a full-service design agency, with years of experience in designing mobile applications, websites, and dashboards. We have worked with the fintech domain and can help you with your product.\nFirst of all, I want to share a portfolio and other links that tell about our agency.\n\nPortfolio --\u003E http://bit.ly/2ZxwcPO\nDribbble --\u003E https://dribbble.com/hbtat\nWebsite --\u003E hbtat.agency\nFeedback from our clients --\u003E https://clutch.co/profile/habitat-design-agency\n\n\nLet me also introduce my team. Our team consists of product designers, UX/UI designers, graphic and web designers, brand designer, social media designer, and 3D \u0026 motion designer. The core principle that guides our work is a human-centered design and we always think about how to improve the usability for the end-user.\n\nWe have a clear understanding of technologies that result in a seamless collaboration with the technical team. Our senior designers possess a significant ability to conceptualize complex systems and create intuitive user flows. Thanks to the tight collaboration and organizational planning, our team is fast and efficient. Also, we practice the Agile framework, conducting daily meetings, planning our sprints, and communicating with our clients regularly. \n\nWe are flexible and at the same time have built a solid design process through the years. Ideally, we begin with profound research on competitors, market and users. We create user personas and afterward move on to wireframes. After the wireframes are finalized, we proceed to the UI part and design fully-clickable prototypes. Apart from that, we can create:\n- unique branding identity, \n- promo and educational videos\n- pitch decks\n- marketing materials, like emails, social media posts, and ads design.\n\nHere are some of the projects from the Fintech domain that we designed:\n- expenses management dashboard Staple -\nhttps://invis.io/AGTCSXV94X5\n\n- Platform that allows shoppers to collect their cashback in cryptocurrencies - Xank\nhttps://invis.io/54VVOHSW7EN\n\n- SaaS for payment terminals Smart Cashier -https://www.upwork.com/agencies/~0117669b3b150615bb/portfolio/project/1181197885464129536\n\n\n If you want we can have a call and discuss further details of the website, your requirements and our capabilities. After that we could estimate time/cost of the design work required.\n\nBest regards,\nVictor\n\nP.s. Habitat is a new name for the agency that was called Shortcute before. That is why we look like a new agency at Upwork, although in reality, we are 4 years old. \nWe went through renaming to better represent our philosophy and services --\u003E https://dribbble.com/shots/8069491-Say-hello-to-Habitat?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot\u0026utm_campaign=hbtat\u0026utm_content=Say%20hello%20to%20Habitat!\u0026utm_medium=Social_Share",
